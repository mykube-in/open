So it's probably a good idea to get a handle on the directory structure used within the pipeline.

\agent_work\1 $(Agent.BuildDirectory)
\agent_work\1\a $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
\agent_work\1\b $(Build.BinariesDirectory)
\agent_work\1\s $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
$(Agent.BuildDirectory) where all folders for a given build pipeline are created

$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination.
$(Build.BinariesDirectory) you can use as an output folder for compiled binaries
$(Build.SourcesDirectory) where your source code files are downloaded
