Behavior of triggers when new branches are created: Here is the behavior when you push a new branch (that matches the branch filters) to your repository:

If your pipeline has path filters, it will be triggered only if the new branch has changes to files that match that path filter.
If your pipeline does not have path filters, it will be triggered even if there are no changes in the new branch.
